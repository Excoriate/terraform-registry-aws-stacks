    # ☁️ AWS DNS delegation in a multi-account environment
    ## Description
    {{ .Header }}
    This module creates a multi-account setup for DNS delegation. There are several assumptions that should be taken into consideration:
    1. There's a `master` account, that's able to override with its `NS` records another account — not managed by this module — which owns the domain.
    2. Several "child accounts where it's possible to create environment-specifics `subdomains` (e.g. `dev`, `staging`, `prod`).
    3. Optionally, in each of these environment-specific accounts, it's possible to create "child zones" which are used to separate resource types, e.g. `api`, `web`, `db`, etc.

    ## Example
    Examples of this module's usage are available in the [examples](./examples) folder.

    ```hcl
    {{ include "../../examples/stack-alb-http/basic/main.tf" }}
    ```

    For module composition, It's recommended to take a look at the module's `outputs` to understand what's available:
    ```hcl
    {{ include "outputs.tf" }}
    ```
